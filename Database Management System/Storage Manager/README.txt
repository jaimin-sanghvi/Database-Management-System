Steps to run assignment functions : 
-----------------------------------
1) Run makefile named as Makefile using linux command (make -f Makefile clean) to remove old object files
2) Run makefile named as Makefile using linux command (make -f Makefile) to generate object files(*.o) and project executable file named as asssign1.
3) Run assign1 exe using linux command (./assign1)

Steps to run extra functions :
------------------------------
4) Run makefile named as Makefile2 using linux command (make -f Makefile2 clean) to remove old object files
5) Run makefile named as Makefile2 using linux command (make -f Makefile2) to generate object files(*.o) and project executable file named as asssign2.
6) Run assign2 exe using linux command (./assign2)

Description about Assignment1 : 
-------------------------------
: We have implemented storage manager as per your insturction :
- We have implemented all functions in storage_mgr.c file.
- We have defined extra error codes (dberror.h File) as per our requirements.
- We have creaded test_assign1_2.c file for extra functions which are implemented in storage_mgr.c file.
